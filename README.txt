# CN-Project
Demonstrating Denial-Of-Service attacks using Socket Programming in Python for a project part of Computer Networks course 

This project was carried out as an assessment for Computer Networks course part of Electronics and Communication Engineering course at PES University

The main contributors to this project are:
    Akshar Deepankar Athreya
    Ashwin Kumar Singh
    Aditya Mandeep Vakani
    Anurag Vinayak Muttur
    
This repository contains the entire python script used to simulate different types of DoS attacks between 2 end systems with the knowledge of the victim's IP address.

We've demonstrated 4 different types of attacks:

    1. UDP Flood
    2. TCP Syn Flood
    3. TCP Rst Flood
    4. ICMP Flood 
    
The python script "dos.py" contains separate functions for each attack and the attacker can choose the attack he wants to carry out.
